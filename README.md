Rhythmiq is a modular, AI-augmented Personal Operating System designed to serve as an externalized executive function for individuals with ADHD. It combines smart task management, chaos detection, AI-powered assistance, and behavioral nudges into a unified platform that works *with* how ADHD brains operate, rather than against them.

## üéØ Project Philosophy

Most productivity systems assume neurotypical executive function. Rhythmiq acknowledges that ADHD brains need different organizational systems:

- **Nonlinear thinking** with structured execution
- **Frictionless capture** with deliberate review  
- **Chaos detection** with gentle intervention
- **Visual progress indicators** for dopamine feedback
- **AI augmentation** for cognitive support
- **Forgiveness built-in** - no guilt for imperfect usage

Tasks (id, title, description, status, priority, is_mit, project, tags, 
       estimated_minutes, actual_minutes, due_date, completed_at, user_id)

-- Idea Management
Ideas (id, title, description, status, category, tags, ai_enriched, 
       ai_enrichment_data, origin, next_step, user_id)
